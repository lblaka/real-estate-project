# Overview
This project analyzes a series of linear regressions to provide recommendations for a King County Real Estate to have a greater understanding on how to properly price homes. Interpretive analysis shows that the number of income per captia and square footage of the home are strong indicators on how to price a home. 
# Business Understanding 
King County Real Estate has contracted us to investigate what features of a home has the greatest impact on pricing a home. Based on our models, Kings County Real Estate should: A) Review the relationship between the square footage of the home and price of a home and B) Review the relationship between income per captia of a neighboorhood and price of a home. 
# Data Analysis & Methodology
The project utilizes a descriptive analysis and linear modeling to reveal which factors contribute most to housing prices. 
# Results

The square feet of the home shows a strong correlation between the size of the home and an increase in the price.

# Conclusion 
Real estate companies working on pricing of homes in King County should consider the square footage of the home, and income per captia of the home to give the most accurate pricing evaluation.

# Next Steps
For more comprehensive evaluation of pricing a home, a real estate company should further inquire into:
- Expanding the data to years beyond 2015, to see if pricing has changed overtime with other important features to the home.
- Include property tax information to better predict price in the future
- Looking at changes in pricing based on individual neighborhoods across King County
